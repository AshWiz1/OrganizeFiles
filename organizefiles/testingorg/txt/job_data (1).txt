job Description 
Role Overview

Developers are encouraged to avoid programming any features until they are actually needed, focusing on clarity of code and test writing. Reviewing and refactoring code is a common, on-going activity. The Pivotal "mindset" can be summarized easily, when taking a story from the backlog each developer is encouraged to do the following:

1. Hypothesis: We believe that ...

2. Test: We will do/make a test that proves...

3. Evidence: We will know the hypothesis is valid if 

Additional to asking these questions, developers are encouraged to think about how long it will take to answer these questions and the cost of solving them. We promote a high trust and highly collaborative culture where everyone is responsible for the quality of their code. A hypothesis driven culture requiring everyone to measure and prove their assumptions. Build, measure, learn is key to our success.

Key Responsibilities:

An ideal candidate is someone who enjoys working in a fast paced, collaborative environment. Someone that values team and leverages the opinions and expertise of their teammates to deliver working, quality code. Each individual values quality and pursues the proof of quality by consistently writing tests.

Experience and practice using TDD to demonstrate functioning code that meets requirements

Ability to work closely with other developers as part of a team or minimally, in a paired environment for 8 hours each day

Strong communication skills and an ability to articulate technical vision while understanding business requirements. A conviction to ones implementation approach but not so unwavering that they cannot be swayed based on sound logic and feedback from their peers to see a higher value" implementation.
